File-Share
==========

This project is designed to create a server using node.js, ideally hosted on a Raspberry Pi or a low cost cost computer. The idea is that the node server will have access to all your music, films and files. You can then stream, download or upload through a Web UI. 


More information will be given about use cases, installation instuctions etc as the project grows.
